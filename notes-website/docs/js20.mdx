## Intro to Promises

A promise is an **object** representing the **eventual completion(usually which takes time) or failure of an asynchronous operation**.

Promises allow us to write an asynchronous code that is much easier to read and understand. Its much flatter, its not so nested.

The prev callback hell example code rewritten to promises looks like this

```javascript
moveXPromise(btn, 100, 000)
  .then(() => moveXPromise(btn, 100, 1000))
  .then(() => moveXPromise(btn, 200, 1000))
  .then(() => moveXPromise(btn, 300, 1000))
  .then(() => moveXPromise(btn, 500, 1000))
  .then(() => moveXPromise(btn, 500, 1000))
  .catch((position) => {
    alert("Cannot move further");
  });
```

**Promises** : **_A pattern_** to write async code.

When we work with promises there are only 2 different things we need to understand

1. How you create a promise. How you could create a function that returns a promise.
2. How you consume and interact with the promises (which we do all the time, even if we are not writing promises ourselves. we might make a req from a library or using a library like axioms )

So promise is a way of promising a value that you may not have at the moment. Its a guarantee or supposed guarantee of an eventual value.

If you are making a HTTP request it could take time and may never return the value. It might be a failure or success and you might get some data backfrom an API but it takes time. **So the object that is returned in the meantime is a promise** and we attach a callback to it.

:::important
A promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

### creating a promise

Syntax:

```javascript
const createPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
```

resolve and reject are actually functions. At any point inside of the function, if we call resolve , promise will be resolved. If we call reject, promise will be rejected

:::note
If you dont resolve or reject a promise, its status will be pending and its value will be undefined
[[PromiseStatus]] : "pending"
[[PromiseValue]] : undefined
:::

```javascript
const willGetYouADog = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
/*[[PromiseStatus]] : "pending"
[[PromiseValue]] : undefined*/
```

pending status is what we see frequently when a promise is first started
